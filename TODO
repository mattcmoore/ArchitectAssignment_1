### WHAT I DID
- Created server route GET uploads
- Served arraylist of "dummy" uploaded files in JSON
- Created post route for CSV files
- Created client for sending CSV files (incomplete, needs RestTemplate config, beans)

Left to do
- Serve a static thymeleaf modal with file upload input and upload button
that will send a file to the route
- Test POST route for csv upload to make sure it works
- Create new Upload objects when new files hit the route (with appropriate
constructor arguments depending on upload and parse status)
- Create static "upload" modal with Thymeleaf, has filepicker input and upload button, that
stores an CSV file as an input, transfers to the UploadClient service
and then POSTS to the "/upload/csv" route
- Create linked "history" modal with Thymeleaf that displays all the info from the history
JSON object at the "/uploads" route
- ALL THE TESTING
